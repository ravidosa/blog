> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:
$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Parameters
- $n = 1000$: upper bound on terms

The [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) is straightforward to generate. Checking if every term is even and adding it to the running total if so arrives at the solution efficiently.
```py
ans = 2

an_1 = 1
an = 2

while an < 4000000:
    an_1, an = an, an_1 + an
    if an % 2 == 0:
        ans += an
```
Generalizing to arbitrary $n$:
```py
ans = 2

an_1 = 1
an = 2

while an < N:
    an_1, an = an, an_1 + an
    if an % 2 == 0:
        ans += an
```
This would have a time complexity of $O(\log n)$, since the Fibonnaci sequence grows exponentially.
